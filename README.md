# IoT_Assignment

This project was created for the ELEC70126 - Internet of Things and Applications module assignment. The primary objective of this project is to explore and identify correlations between human behavior, such as mobile app usage patterns, and environmental factors.

Interactive Jupyter Notebook and Voila Integration
To enhance the presentation of charts and plots, this project utilizes the Voila framework, which transforms Jupyter Notebooks into interactive web applications. This allows for a user-friendly interface to visualize data interactively.

How to Use:
Open the interactive Jupyter Notebook by clicking on the following link: [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/StartZer0/IoT_Assignment/ca0f9e020f524adad8cbe46fb27a854705a2c66c?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2FIoT_Assignment.ipynb)

Once the Notebook is loaded:

- Locate the yellow Voila button on the top menu of the Jupyter Notebook interface.
- Click the button to launch the Voila web application.
- The Voila application will render the notebook into a simplified and interactive web-based dashboard.

  This dashboard will display:

 - Dynamic charts and plots for better visualization.
 - A streamlined interface for exploring the project's results without requiring direct interaction with the Jupyter Notebook code.
